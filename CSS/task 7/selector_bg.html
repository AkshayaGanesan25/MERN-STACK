            Diwali is a five day festival starts on Dhanteras. On Dhanteras people buy jewellery or utensils and worship to God. The second day is called Naraka Chaturdashi. It marks the death of the demon king “Narakasura”. It is also called Chhoti Diwali or Small Diwali. According to an interesting saying it is believed that those who do not bathe on this day go to the hell. They put flowers and mango leaves on their doors and windows. Firecrackers are burst in order to drive away evil spirits. During Diwali, all the celebrants wear new clothes, share sweets and snacks with family members and friends.
