        <h2> The Goose and the Golden Eggs</h2>  
<h3>Moral: Greed leads to loss.</h3>
<p>Once upon a time, in a quiet little village surrounded by green meadows and sparkling streams, there lived a poor farmer named Ramu. He worked hard every day from sunrise to sunset, tending to his fields, feeding his cattle, and mending fences. But despite his efforts, he barely earned enough to feed his family. His clothes were old, his house was small, and his dreams of a better life seemed far away.

One morning, while cleaning his small barn, Ramu noticed something unusual. One of his geese had laid a strange-looking egg.
<br> It shone brightly, reflecting the sunlight like polished metal. He picked it up carefully and was astonished — it was a golden egg!

<br>At first, he thought his eyes were deceiving him. “Could this be real gold?” he murmured in disbelief. To be sure, he carried the egg to the nearby town and showed it to a goldsmith. The goldsmith examined it closely, tapped it gently, and exclaimed, “This is pure gold! Where did you find it?”

Ramu could hardly believe his luck. He sold the golden egg for a large sum of money and returned home with joy in his heart.
<br> That night, he thanked his goose for bringing such fortune into his life.

The next morning, to his surprise, the same goose laid another golden egg.
<br> And the next day, another. Day after day, the goose continued to lay one golden egg. Slowly, Ramu’s poverty began to disappear. He bought new clothes for his wife and children, repaired his old house, and even purchased more land for farming. The villagers, once pitying him, now admired his success and good fortune.

Ramu’s life had completely changed. He no longer had to worry about where his next meal would come from. But as time passed, something changed within him. The farmer who was once humble and hardworking began to grow greedy and impatient.

He thought to himself, “Every day, the goose lays just one golden egg. That means only one coin’s worth of gold a day. But what if inside her body, there are dozens of golden eggs? If I cut her open, I could have them all at once and become rich instantly!”

For many nights, he struggled with his thoughts. <br>Part of him knew it was wrong to harm the goose that had brought him so much happiness. But his greed grew stronger each day, whispering in his ear, “Why wait for tomorrow when you can have everything today?”

Finally, one morning, Ramu decided he could not wait any longer. He took a sharp knife, caught the goose gently, and whispered, “Don’t worry, dear goose. Soon I’ll have all the golden eggs, and we’ll never have to struggle again.”

With one quick motion, he cut the goose open. But to his horror, there were no golden eggs inside. The goose was just like any other. Ramu’s heart sank as he realized what he had done. He had killed the very creature that had made him wealthy.

For a moment, he just stood there, speechless. Then tears filled his eyes as he understood the terrible mistake he had made. “Oh no! My greed has destroyed everything!” he cried. He had lost his only source of fortune. There would be no more golden eggs — not today, not ever again.

Days turned into weeks, and soon Ramu’s wealth began to vanish. Without the golden eggs, he had nothing left to sell. His savings ran out, his fields grew barren, and he was forced to return to the same life of hardship he had lived before — perhaps even worse, for now he had tasted wealth and lost it forever.

The villagers, upon hearing what happened, shook their heads sadly.
<br> “How foolish he was,” they said. “If only he had been patient, he would have continued to prosper for the rest of his life.”

Ramu, filled with regret, would often sit by his empty barn and whisper to himself, “Greed destroys everything. I had everything I needed, but my impatience and selfishness have left me with nothing.”

<b>Moral and Meaning
</b>
<br>
The story of “The Goose and the Golden Eggs” teaches one of the most valuable lessons in life — greed leads to loss. Ramu had enough to live comfortably, but he wanted more and more, faster than he deserved. Instead of being content and grateful for what he already had, he let his greed blind him to reason.
<br>
This story reminds us that patience and gratitude are more rewarding than greed and haste. When we chase after instant results, we often end up losing what we already have. Many people in life make the same mistake — whether in work, relationships, or wealth — by wanting everything at once. They forget that true success takes time and effort.
<br>
The goose in the story can also be seen as a symbol of opportunity. In our lives, we all have “golden geese” — talents, friendships, jobs, or even good habits that bring us long-term happiness. But if we overuse or destroy them out of greed or impatience, we lose them forever.
