    <p>Little <b><mark>Rohan</mark></b> loved exploring the woods behind his house. One afternoon, he heard a <i>tiny meow</i>, a sound he'd never heard before in that part of the forest. Following the sound, he found a small, scared kitten with <u>fluffy white fur, shivering </u>under a bush. The <em>kitten</em> looked lost and lonely, and Rohan felt a surge of sympathy.
        He gently scooped up the kitten, which immediately purred and nuzzled into his arms. 
        <br>"Don't worry," Rohan whispered, "I'll take care of you." He carried the kitten home, where his parents helped him clean it and gave it a warm bath and some milk. 
        They searched for the kitten's owner, putting up flyers and asking around the village, but no one claimed the little white cat. Rohan named him "Snowy" and they became the best of friends.
        <br> Snowy followed Rohan everywhere, and Rohan was never lonely in the woods again. 
        <br>
